# AlgoTrader
This Python project is a trading strategy development tool. It involves:

- Data Preparation: Processing historical market data for analysis.
- Strategy Implementation: Defining and implementing specific trading strategies, such as trend-following or mean-reversion.
- Backtesting: Simulating the strategy's performance on historical data to evaluate its effectiveness.
- Parameter Optimization: Fine-tuning strategy parameters to maximize potential returns.
- Walk-Forward Analysis: Assessing the strategy's robustness by testing it on rolling windows of data.
- Result Analysis: Analyzing the backtesting results, including performance metrics like Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and profit and loss.

The code leverages various Python libraries for data analysis, numerical computation, including NumPy, Polars, and potentially others.
